Motivation:
- The group is tasked with helping a winery in the north of Portugal improve the quality of their
"Vinho Verde" varietal for both their red and white variants.
- Two datasets are included related to red and white 'vinho verde' wine samples, from the north of Portugal.
- The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests to recommend ways to maximize quality.

Questions:
- What are the different factors that influence red and white 'vinho verde' variants?
- How can these factors be influenced to separately improve the quality of both variants?
