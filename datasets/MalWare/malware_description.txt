Dataset Description
The goal of this competition is to predict a Windows machine’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. The telemetry data containing these properties and the machine infections was generated by combining heartbeat and threat reports collected by Microsoft's endpoint protection solution, Windows Defender.

Each row in this dataset corresponds to a machine, uniquely identified by a MachineIdentifier. HasDetections is the ground truth and indicates that Malware was detected on the machine. Using the information and labels in train.csv, you must predict the value for HasDetections for each machine in test.csv.

The sampling methodology used to create this dataset was designed to meet certain business constraints, both in regards to user privacy as well as the time period during which the machine was running. Malware detection is inherently a time-series problem, but it is made complicated by the introduction of new machines, machines that come online and offline, machines that receive patches, machines that receive new operating systems, etc. While the dataset provided here has been roughly split by time, the complications and sampling requirements mentioned above may mean you may see imperfect agreement between your cross validation, public, and private scores! Additionally, this dataset is not representative of Microsoft customers’ machines in the wild; it has been sampled to include a much larger proportion of malware machines.


Columns
Unavailable or self-documenting column names are marked with an "NA".

MachineIdentifier - Individual machine ID
ProductName - Defender state information e.g. win8defender

AppVersion - Defender state information e.g. 4.9.10586.0
AvSigVersion - Defender state information e.g. 1.217.1014.0
IsBeta - Defender state information e.g. false
RtpStateBitfield - NA
IsSxsPassiveMode - NA
...
Census_IsPenCapable - Is the device capable of pen input ?
Census_IsAlwaysOnAlwaysConnectedCapable - Retreives information about whether the battery enables the device to be AlwaysOnAlwaysConnected .
Wdft_IsGamer - Indicates whether the device is a gamer device or not based on its hardware combination.
Wdft_RegionIdentifier - NA


Inspiration
- Can we predict the price of each house in different regions?
- Can we describe a region using the names of listings in that region?
- What can we learn about different regions from the data?
- Based on different factors is it possible to recommend a title to the host for his/her listing?
- Can we estimate the popularity of a listing based on given features?

Student Team Ideas:
- We will be working on a project aimed at predicting the probability of a Windows machine
getting infected by various families of malware.
- Using Power BI we can analyse various aspects using telemetry data generated by Microsoft's endpoint protection solution, Windows Defender. 
- The dataset comprises machine properties, with each row uniquely identified by a Machine Identifier, and the target variable, Has Detections, indicates whether malware was detected on the machine. The data will be used to predict the malware.
